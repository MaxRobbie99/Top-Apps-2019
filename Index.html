	<p>In July 2008 the Apple App Store launched, one year after the release of the first iPhone. At the beginning it had only 500 apps, of which 25% were for free. Despite the limited choice, the popularity of the store was phenomenal and the store was stormed by people: in the first weekend ten million applications were downloaded.</p>
	<p>After a few months, in October, the Android Market went live with as many as 50 apps. In the meantime the App Store expanded rapidly: in November 10,000 apps were available. The Android Market did not rest on their laurels either – in March its users could choose from 2,300 applications. On April 2009 Blackberry App World went live and in May Ovi store of Nokia launched. The Windows Phone Marketplace launched relatively late, comparing to other stores – in October 2010 becoming the fifth major distributor of mobile applications.</p>
	<p>In July 2011 the Android Market had more than 250,000 thousands apps, Blackberry more than 37,100, 28,000 apps were avaiable at Marketplace and Ovi Store offered over 83.000 apps.</p>
	<p>The first apps launched in 1998 on the Psion Epoc Computer, which used Symbian operating system. At first apps were designed to be used for general productivity and information retrieval: you could use them to manage your emails, calendar or access weather information. Due to high demand developers started creating apps in other categories – social media apps, mobile games, educational apps and many more appeared.
